# Drafted — a producibles harness that compounds

Drafted makes any AI more effective by giving it a memory and a workspace that get better with use. It has three primitives that layer:

- **Knowledge — the org wiki.** Durable facts, decisions, conventions. *More knowledge = less searching.*
- **Procedures — skills.** Reusable SOPs the org has encoded. *Better skills = more stable process.*
- **Surface — projects.** Reviewable work as frames on a shared zoomable canvas the user watches live at `https://drafted.live`. *Reusable projects + anchors = velocity with accuracy.*

The point is the **compounding loop**: you don't produce in a vacuum, you draw on what the org already knows and leave it richer each pass.

## The surface is a filesystem — one tool, one path grammar

There is exactly **one** tool to know: `fs`. It looks, feels, and behaves like a local filesystem. Three roots:

```
/wiki/<path>                                  org knowledge pages (markdown, free nesting)
/skills/<slug>                                reusable procedures (flat: one dir per skill)
/projects/<project>/<layer>/<lane>/<file>     frames on the surface (project → layer → lane → file)
```

Verbs: `ls` (list) · `read` (cat, hashline-annotated) · `write` (create/overwrite) · `edit` (hashline ops) · `mv` (rename/move) · `rm` (move to archive) · `mkdir` (create a project) · `search` (grep).

**A project is a folder.** It starts with **no layers** — writing to `/projects/<name>/<layer>/...` auto-creates the layer (mkdir -p). The agent defines the filesystem structure by writing into it. URLs are the same paths: `https://drafted.live/o/<org>/projects/<project>/<layer>/<lane>/<file>`.

## The loop — prime → build → compound

- **Prime (session start).** Pull accumulated value in. The system *enforces* this: you must search the wiki before working (G1), and a project's attached skills and anchored frames are required reading when you open it. Don't fight the gates — they make you start smart.
- **Build (the work).** Produce artifacts as frames on the surface.
- **Compound (session end / when you notice something).** Deposit learning back: capture knowledge, distill or fix a skill, harden the project. This is *your* responsibility — the system can't force it, so do it.

## The gates you'll encounter (and how to satisfy them)

These reset every session. A gate that blocks you tells you exactly what to call next — do it, don't work around it.

- **G1 — wiki search before work.** Before reading or editing anything, `fs(search, path="/wiki", query="<terms>")` for relevant org knowledge.
- **G2 — prior-art before a new skill.** Writing a new `/skills/<slug>` requires `fs(search, path="/skills", query="<topic>")` first.
- **G3 — prior-art before a new project.** Creating a project requires wiki + skill searches first.
- **G4 — attached skills** are auto-injected when you open a project. Follow them — they're how the org does this work.
- **G5 — the project's anchored frames** are required reading (briefs, constraints, style guides).
- **G6 — a layer's rules** are surfaced when you work in that layer. Honor them.

## The commands (when to reach for each)

These bookend the loop. Prime/feed at the start, deposit at the end.

- `/drafted:onboard-drafted` — first run: orient + bootstrap the harness (seed wiki, starter skills, first project).
- `/drafted:ingest` — bring knowledge into the wiki (a research output, existing documents, or by interrogating the user).
- `/drafted:create-skill` — capture a repeatable procedure (with knowledge + prior-art search).
- `/drafted:create-project` — start a project or a reusable template (with knowledge/skill/template search).
- `/drafted:improve-wiki` — fix stale / wrong / fragmented knowledge.
- `/drafted:improve-skill` — fix a skill that underperformed.
- `/drafted:improve-project-harness` — turn corrections into enforced gates (anchors / attached skills / layer rules).
- `/drafted:extract` — session-end: deposit knowledge, a skill, and/or a template (the user picks which).

## Working on the surface

- **Navigate by path, exactly like a filesystem.** `fs(ls, path="/projects")` to see projects; `fs(ls, path="/projects/<project>")` for layers/lanes; `fs(ls, path="/projects/<project>/<layer>")` for frames. The project is resolved from the path itself — no separate "open" step.
- **Create a project with `fs(mkdir, path="/projects/<name>")`** — or just `fs(write, path="/projects/<name>/<layer>/<lane>/<file>", content=...)` and the project + layer auto-create.
- **Default to the surface for substantive artifacts.** When asked to draft, write, plan, analyze, compare, design, document, summarize, report, spec, model, or make a deck/table, create or update frames instead of leaving the durable result only in chat. One visible frame per artifact or section.
- **Read before editing.** `fs(read)` returns every line hashline-annotated (`1abc|<content>`); `fs(edit, ops=[{type:"replace", lineHash:"1abc", newContent:"..."}])` targets exactly that line. For partial reads, pass `lines: "2-50"` — you get back just that range, still hash-annotated, and can edit within it.
- **Prefer Google Workspace when Drive is connected.** Use `fs(write, path=".../<name>.google-doc"|".google-sheet"|".google-slide")` for docs, sheets, and decks; populate immediately with the matching native write action.
- **`fs(mv, from="/projects/<p>/<layer>/<lane>/<file>", to="...")`** renames or moves (cross-project too). **`fs(rm, path="/projects/<project>")` archives** — agents never hard-delete; the archive is in the web UI.
- **Return a clickable link** for what you touched — the `frameUrl`/`projectUrl` in the fs response is the URL the user opens.

## Quality conventions

- **Match format to layer intent.** Research/strategy/copy are usually markdown; visual work (wireframes, designs, dashboards) is HTML.
- **Wireframes are low-fidelity** (grayscale, placeholders); reserve color and real content for the designs/final layer.
- **Choose dimensions to fit content** — `autoSize: true` for HTML, or explicit `width`/`height`.
- **Don't re-read unchanged frames** you already have this conversation.
- **Diagrams: prefer native Excalidraw.** For flowcharts, process maps, architecture/system/data-flow diagrams, or visual maps, write a `.excalidraw` file (scene JSON) and load the `excalidraw-drafted` skill for the authoring guidance. Use HTML/markdown frames for web/UI mockups, rich layouts, or non-editable artifacts.

## Skill authoring

- **Git is the source of truth for skills; Drafted renders, indexes, and searches.** When a repo is connected to a folder, the skills under `.agents/skills/` in that repo ARE the skills for that folder — authoring happens by committing to git, not by writing into Drafted. Drafted write paths for a repo-owned skill return `409 repo_owned` naming the repo, branch, and path to commit to. Use `repo(action="rescan")` after a push so the index reflects the change.
- **For a folder with NO connected repo, author skills in Drafted** with `fs(write, path="/skills/<slug>", content=..., readme=...)` (G2 gate first). A `README.md` is required (the `readme` param) so the skill directory is self-documenting. `fs(mv, path="/skills/<old>", to="/skills/<new>")` renames.
- **Knowledge goes in the wiki, procedure in skills.** Drafted owns org knowledge (wiki pages via `fs` under `/wiki/`); git owns reusable procedure (skills under `.agents/skills/`). Don't put a skill body in a wiki page or a knowledge doc in a SKILL.md.
- **Machine-specific build output is never portable.** Build `node_modules`, downloaded browsers, compiled binaries into a `.skillinstall/` directory inside the skill — Drafted always strips it on push and skill push auto-gitignores it, so the rebuildable bundle stays local while the method and recipe live in git/Drafted.
- **Improve skills when you find a better way.** Fix or distill a skill that underperformed rather than leaving it stale.

## Surface URL recognition

Any URL containing `/f/{uuid}` is a Drafted frame link — `fs(read, path=URL)` gets its content. Canonical links are the fs paths themselves: `/o/<org>/wiki/...`, `/o/<org>/skills/<slug>`, `/o/<org>/projects/<project>/<layer>/<lane>/<file>`. Never `WebFetch` Drafted URLs — the MCP tools authenticate properly.
